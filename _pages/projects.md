* CancerKG (Big Lab, @FSU)
  * Web-scale, trustworthy Knowledge Graph on Cancer learned from millions of Web sources. The project is currently in progress. [\[Link\]](http://www.cancerkg.org/) <br> 
* Cloudchomp (Tekvortex Pvt. Ltd)
  * An analytics tool to assist organizations in making data-driven decisions regarding the migration of resources from local private servers to AWS cloud. Enhanced the existing module by adding features such as disk, and memory usages analysis to help clients decide on migrating from on-premises servers to AWS Cloud.
* Feature recognition of CAD data (E&T Nepal Pvt. Ltd)
  * Automated 3D model recognition software for leading manufacturing industry in Japan. Collaborated with an expert team of Japan and Nepal to design software based on C++ using ACIS and spatial libraries from Spatial. The softwareâ€™s objectives included recognizing geometrical shapes, identifying parts in CAD data of pins, measuring their attributes (e.g.,dimensions), and extracting text information using OCR (Tesseract, Leptonica).
* Real Time Person Identification and Location Detection using Face Recognition
  * Undergraduate Major Project using Open CV library for image processing. Collaborated with team members to collect sample images used in training the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and implemented PCA-LDA algorithm for face recognition [\[PDF\]](https://github.com/gyan-shrestha/gyanendrashrestha.github.io/tree/master/files/Major_project_BEX.pdf) [\[Code\]](https://github.com/gyan-shrestha/face_recognition)
