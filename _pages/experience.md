Graduate Research Assistant
======
*  Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science working on developing deep learning embedding models for tabular data understanding to aid table search and data 
fusion.
   * BigLab: Developed transformer-based model aligned with BERT configurations to create structurally aware composite embeddings for tables with complex structured data, outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 28%. Fine-tuned Large Language Models like GPT2, Llama2, and several transformer-based deep learning models, as well as classic Word2vec NLP embedding model on large-scale structured datasets.
   * Bioinformatics Lab: Worked on Complex Structural Variant (SV) detection using long read DNA sequencing data. Utilized the union-find 
algorithm for clustering potential SVs from aligned long reads.
